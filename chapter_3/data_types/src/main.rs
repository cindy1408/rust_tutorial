    // Scalar Types -> represents a single value, there are 4 sclar types: integers, floating-point, bumbers, Booleans and characters. 
    
    let signedInt: i32; // <- this variable is signed integer that takes up 32 bits of space (positive or negative sign) this is also the default

    // THE COMPOUND TYPE

        // 1. THE TUPLE TYPE - grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type, they have a fixed length and size. 

        let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.5, 1); // the variable tup binds to the entire tuple as a single compound element.

        let (x, y, z) = tup; 

        println!("The value of y is: {}", y); 

        // Tuple can also be accessed directly by using a period '.' followed by the index of the value: 

        let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4 ,1); 

        let five_hundred = x.0; 
        let six_point_four = x.1; 
        let one = x.2; 

        // tuples without any values contains one value, written (). It's called a unit type and the value is called the unit value. 

        // THE ARRAY TYPE - every element must have the same value and have a fix length

        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 

        // Arrays are allocated in the stack instead of the heap 

        let months = ["January", "Feburary", "March", "April", "May"]; 

        let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // this specifies the array is i32 type with a length of 5 elements

        let a = [3; 5]; // means : initalising the array with 5 3s in the array
