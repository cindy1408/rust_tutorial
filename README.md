Chapter 1 

// cargo build will create an executable file
// cargo.lock keep tracks of the exact version of the dependencies in this project (Cargo.lock is a self sufficient file that maintains itself)

// cargo new project_name will create the filename in the directory.

// cargo run will run the binary file directly if no changes were made, if changes were made, cargo run will build the binary file before running it. 

// cargo check will check if the code written will compile but doesn't execute it. 

// result of the build is saved in target/debug directory when cargo build is used. 

// use cargo build --release to compile it with optimisation (creates a build in target/release instead of target/debug)
